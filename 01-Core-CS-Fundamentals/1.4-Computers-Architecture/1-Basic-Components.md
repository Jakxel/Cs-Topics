# Basics Components Of Computer Hardware
Computer hardware oncludes the physcal part of a computer. it refers to the computer systems, especially those that forms part of the centar processing unit.
**What is computer hardware?**:
Computer hardware includes the physical components of a computer. Personal computer(PCs) are electronics devices that uses microships to process information and may include desktop computer, laptop or tablets. Since a computer comprises many hardware components, they work togheter and depend on each other to function properly.

# What are basic components of computer hardware?
There are severa basic components of computer hardware including:
## CPU
**Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: the CPU control the computer processes and communicates with the other components of a personal computer. A computer's CPU may be one of the most complicated part of the computer because of its inticacies.
The central Processing Unit is teh core of any computer devices. it comprises three major components of the coomputer:
- Memory Unit
- Control Unit
- Arithmetic and logical UNIt 
ALL these three unit are elemnts of CPU and together help in the efficinet working and processing of data

## Memory
Computer memory is just like the human brain. It is used to store data/information and instructions. It is a data storage unit or a data storage device where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. It can store both the input and output can be stored here.
### Diference between RAM and ROM
**Random Access Memory (RAM)**: RAM is where data liives temporarily while it's being actively used by pograms.
**Read Only Memory (ROM)**: ROM is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices

## Buses and I/O systems
**Buses**:
**Inout Devices**:
**Output Devices**:
