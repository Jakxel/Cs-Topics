# OSI/TCP-IP models

## What is a OSI/TCP-IP model?

The model OSI and TCP-IP are concept models that describes how the data is transmitted for the net, each whit its different approach.
The OSI models it's a frame of reference more general and theoretical with seven layers, for other part the TCP-IP models its a more practical and used in the internet implementation, with four layers.

## OSI model
**OSI(Open Systems Interconection)**
A frame of concept reference what divides the communications in seven layers, each whit especifics functions
### Layers
1. **Application layer**
2. **Presentation layer**
3. **Sesion layer**
4. **Trasport layer**
5. **Net layer**
6. **Data enlace layer**
7. **Fisic Layer**

### Function
Provides a estructure for understand and analize the communication in net.

## TCP-IP model
**TCP/IP(Transmition Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)**
A practic model and used in the internet, that organize the net communication in four layers.

### Layers:
1. **Aplication layer**
2. **Transport layer**
3. **Internet layer**
4. **Data enlace layer / Fisic layer**

### Function
Defines the communication in internet and the gestion of data between devices.
