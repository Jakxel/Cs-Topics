# What is a Network?

A **network** is a group of interconnected devices that can communicate and share resources. Think of it as a system where computers and other devices exchange information, collaborate, and access shared resources like printers or storage.

Computers use common **communication protocols** over **digital interconnections** to communicate with each other. These interconnections are built using **telecommunications network technologies**, which may be based on physical wiring, optical fiber, or wireless radio-frequency methods. These can be arranged in a variety of **network topologies**.

## Network Packet

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on **packet-mode transmission**. A **network packet** is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

A packet consists of two types of data:
- **Control information**
- **User data** (also called the **payload**)

The control information provides the network with the necessary data to deliver the user payload correctly. This includes things like:
- Source and destination network addresses  
- Error detection codes  
- Sequencing information  

Typically, the control information is found in the **packet header**, while the payload is carried in the body of the packet.

# Types of Networks

There are several types of networks, each with a distinct scope and purpose.  
Key examples include **Local Area Networks (LANs)** and **Wide Area Networks (WANs)** for broader geographical communication, as well as **Personal Area Networks (PANs)** for individual devices.

Other notable types include:
- **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)**
- **Campus Area Networks (CANs)**
- **Virtual networks**, such as **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**:  
  A LAN connects computers and devices within a **limited area**, such as a home, office, or building, using a common communication path. It is fast, reliable, and typically privately owned.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**:  
  A MAN covers a **larger area than a LAN**, such as a city or a large campus. It is used to interconnect several LANs within a metropolitan region, often operated by governments or large organizations.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**:  
  A WAN spans a **very large geographical area**, such as multiple cities, countries, or even continents. It connects multiple LANs and is often maintained by telecom providers. The internet is the most well-known example of a WAN.

- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**:  
  A PAN is the **smallest and simplest type of network**, used to connect personal devices over a short range — typically a few meters. Examples include Bluetooth connections between a smartphone and a smartwatch or wireless headphones.

  
# Types of Network Topology

**Network topology** refers to the arrangement of different elements such as nodes, links, or devices in a computer network.  
Common types of network topology include **bus**, **star**, **ring**, **mesh**, and **tree** topologies—each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

## What is Network Topology?

Network topology is the way devices are connected in a network. It defines how components communicate and how data is transmitted across the network.

There are **two major categories** of network topology:

- **Physical Topology**: Refers to the actual physical layout of the devices and cables.
- **Logical Topology**: Refers to the flow of data within the network, regardless of its physical design.

## Types of Topologies

###  Point-to-Point
A **point-to-point topology** is the simplest form of connection, involving a direct link between two devices: one sender and one receiver. It provides high bandwidth and is typically used in basic communication setups.

### Mesh Topology
In a **mesh topology**, every device is connected to every other device via dedicated links. This provides high redundancy and reliability.  
Protocols used include:
- **AHCP** (Ad Hoc Configuration Protocol)
- **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

### Bus Topology
In **bus topology**, all devices are connected to a single communication line (the bus). Data travels in both directions, but if the main cable (backbone) fails, the whole network goes down.

Common MAC (Media Access Control) protocols:
- **TDMA** (Time Division Multiple Access)
- **CDMA** (Code Division Multiple Access)
- **ALOHA**, **Slotted ALOHA**

### Star Topology
In a **star topology**, all devices are connected to a single central hub using cables. The hub can be:
- **Passive** (just forwards signals)
- **Active** (includes repeaters and signal boosters)

Commonly used cables: **Coaxial**, **RJ-45**  
Common protocols: **CSMA/CD** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

### Ring Topology
In **ring topology**, each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed loop. Data travels in one direction, and repeaters are often needed for networks with many nodes to avoid signal loss.

### Tree Topology
A **tree topology** is a hierarchical combination of star and bus topologies. Secondary hubs connect to a central hub (with a repeater), forming branches. If the central hub fails, the entire network may go down.

###  Hybrid Topology
A **hybrid topology** combines two or more different types of topologies (e.g., star + ring). It allows flexibility, as individual segments can follow different configurations depending on the needs of the network.
Each component uses the appropriate protocols according to the sub-topology it belongs to.

# Client-Server vs peer-to-peer models

## Client-server model
A computing model where a server hosts, manages, and delivers resources and services to one or more clients. Clients are devices or programs that request these resources and services from the server over a network. This model is commonly used in various applications, including web services, database management, and email systems.

## Peer-to-Perr model:
A decentralized network where participants (peers) interact directly with each other, sharing resources and services without relying on a central server. Each peer acts as both a client and a server, enabling distributed sharing and creating a more robust network compared to the client-server model.


| Feature                    | Client-Server Model                                  | Peer-to-Peer Model                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Architecture**          | Centralized                                          | Decentralized                                            |
| **Resource Management**   | Managed by the server                                | Shared by all peers                                      |
| **Scalability**           | Highly scalable with proper infrastructure           | Limited by individual peers' capabilities                |
| **Examples**              | Web services, email systems, databases               | File sharing (e.g., BitTorrent), blockchain networks     |
| **Dependency**            | Relies on a central server                           | No central dependency; all nodes are equal               |
| **Maintenance**           | Easier to manage and control                         | Harder to manage due to distributed nature               |


## CLient-Server vs Peer-to-Peer
While the client-server model has inherent advantages that make it suitable for scenarios requiring centralized management and scalability, the peer-to-peer model excels in situations that benefit from decentralization and direct sharing of resources. Understanding these distinctions can help in choosing the most appropriate network model based on specific needs and requirements.
