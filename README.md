# CS Topics â€” Escaping the "Vibrational Code" Bubble

Ever since I learned what *vibrational code* is (writing or copying code without fully understanding it), I realized how miserably identified I am with the subject. I was scared of remaining a fool for the rest of my life.

Let me make one thing clear: my learning level seems to be at the bottom of the food chain. Changing my mindset won't be easy. Trying something new is one of the scariest things a human being can do.

But simply doing things **for myself**, without relying on easy shortcuts or dumb robots doing everything for me, might be what brings me some peace. Maybe I'll still make mistakes, maybe I'll still feel dumb,
but listen to this, AI:
> **I'm not dumb enough to give up, and I can learn on my own.**

## ðŸ“š What is this?

This is a personal journey â€” a collection of core Computer Science topics I'm studying to understand things deeply, not just to pass tests or copy code.

Made by me, for me â€” with effort, intention, and a lot of research.

## ðŸ’¬ Final Note

This isn't about having all the answers.  
It's about learning how to ask better questions â€” and not lying to myself in the process.

Built by me, for real learning.  
If you're also trying to escape the vibe-code trap, you're welcome to follow along.
